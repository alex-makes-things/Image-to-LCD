# Image-to-LCD
A tkinter GUI-based tool to transform any image into a microcontroller-friendly C array

To use it, just drop the file into the same directory as your images, execute it, choose your image and convert it. It will create a file with the same name as the selected image, with a .h extension, ready to be used in a microcontroller display-based project as an RGB bitmap.
